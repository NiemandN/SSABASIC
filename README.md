# SSABASIC
Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is a non-parametric technique of time series analysis and forecasting. SSA aims at decomposing the original series in a small number of possibly interpretable components such as a slowly varying trend, oscillatory components, and noise. This implementation is based on the book "Analysis of Time Series Structure: SSA and Related Techniques" by N. Golyandina, V. Nekrutkin, and A. Zhigljavsky, 2001. More examples can be found in the paper [Singular Spectrum Analysis: Back to Basics](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5136637).
